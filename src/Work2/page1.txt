Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago,
[5][6] West initially gained recognition
as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the
early 2000s, producing singles for several
artists and developing the "chipmunk soul" sampling style.
 Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his
  debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), to critical
 and commercial success.
  He founded the record label GOOD Music later that year.
  West explored diverse musical elements like orchestras,
  synthesizers, and autotune on the albums Late Registration (2005),
 Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008).
 His fifth and sixth albums My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010)
 and Yeezus (2013) were also met with critical and commercial success.
 West further diversified his musical styles on The Life of Pablo (2016)
 and Ye (2018) and explored Christian and gospel music on Jesus Is King (2019).
 His tenth album Donda (2021) was released to continued commercial success but
 mixed critical reception. West's discography also includes the two full-length
collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z and Kids See Ghosts (2018)
 with Kid Cudi.
